/**
 * SpotViewModel manages spot data, seeding, and display logic for WorkHaven.
 * 
 * This view model provides:
 * - Spot data management with Core Data integration
 * - Automatic spot discovery and seeding based on location and time
 * - Intelligent sorting by distance and overall rating
 * - Error handling with user-friendly messages
 * - Theme integration for consistent UI styling
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Initialize with @StateObject in SwiftUI views
 * - Call loadSpots(near:) to load and seed spots for a location
 * - Monitor @Published properties for UI updates
 * - Handle errors via errorMessage property
